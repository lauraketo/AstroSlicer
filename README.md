# The CellRemorph Toolkit

A Blender-based toolkit for transforming cell morphologies from polygonal surface meshes into adjustable surface point clouds and vice versa, precisely selecting nanoprocesses, and slicing morphologies into segments with equal surface areas or volumes. 

 

## Prerequisites 

The toolkit was developed and tested on Blender 3.4, which can be downloaded at https://www.blender.org/download/. 

 

## The tools 

 

### Selector 

Selecting nanoprocesses from surface point clouds or polygonal surface meshes and saving them into separate surface point cloud or polygonal surface mesh structures, respectively. 

 

### Transformer 

Transforming morphologies from surface point clouds into polygonal surface meshes and vice versa. 

 

### Slicer 

Slicing surface mesh structures along any of the three axes to produce a desired number of segments equal either in volume or surface area
